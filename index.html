        <h1>Drug Consumption</h1>
        <p> The purpose of this project is to examine the patterns and behaviors of individuals who use illegal drugs. To do so, we will be using data from the UCI drug consumption dataset, which includes information about drug use and other relevant factors for a large number of respondents. <br>

            First, we will start by analyzing general statistics about the respondents, such as their demographics, drug use history, and other characteristics. This will help us to get a general sense of the population we are studying and identify any trends or patterns that may be present. <br>
            
            Next, we will focus on evaluating the behavioral scores of the respondents using the Big 5 personality scores. This will involve analyzing the scores on each of the five dimensions of personality (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) and determining how they may be related to drug use. <br> For example, we may find that individuals who score higher on certain dimensions of personality are more likely to use drugs or that drug use is associated with changes in personality scores over time.
            
            Overall, our goal is to gain a better understanding of the relationships between drug use and behavior, with the hope that this will help us to develop more effective strategies for addressing the problem of illicit drug use.</p>
